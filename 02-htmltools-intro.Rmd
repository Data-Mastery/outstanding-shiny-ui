# About htmltools
While building a custom html template, you will need to know more about the wonderful [htmltools](https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools) developed by Winston Chang, member of the shiny core team. It has the same spirit as devtools, that is, making your web developer life easier. What follows does not have the pretention to be an exhaustive guide about this package. Yet, it will provide you yith the main
tools to be more efficient.

## HTML Tags
Both shiny and htmltools contain tags. However, by experience, htmltools contains more exported tags than shiny.
For instance, the HTML `<nav></nav>` tag, namely `tags$nav()` in R is not included in the shiny package but 
in htmltools. 

Within your package code, your tags will be like:

```r
# we use htmltools tags instead of shiny
htmltools::tags$div(...)
```

If you had to gather multiple tags together, prefer `tagList()` as `list()`, although the HTML output is the same. The first
has the shiny.tag.list class in addition to list.

### Notations
Whether to use `tags$div` or `div` is the tag is exported by default.
For instance, you could use `htmltools::div` but not `htmltools::nav` since nav does not 
have a dedicated function (only for p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, a, br, div, span, pre, code, img, strong, em, hr). 
Rather use `htmltools::tags$nav`. Alternatively, there exists a function (in shiny and htmltools) 
called `withTags()`. Wrapping your code in this function enables you to use `withTags(nav(), ...)` 
instead of `tags$nav()`.


### Alternative way to write tags
htmltools and shiny come with the `HTML()` function that you can feed with raw HTML:

```r
HTML('<div>Blabla</div>')
# will render exactly like
div("Blabla")

# but there class is different
class(HTML('<div>Blabla</div>'))
class(div("Blabla"))
```

You will not be able to use tag related functions, as in the following parts.
Therefore, I strongly recommand using R and not mixing HTML in R.

### Tags structure
According to the htmltools `tag()` function, a tag has:
- a name such as span, div, h1 ...
- attributes, which you can access with `tag$attribs`
- children, which you can access with `tag$children`
- a class, namely "shiny.tag"

For instance:

```r
# create the tag
myTag <- div(
  class = "divclass", 
  id = "first",
  h1("Here comes your baby"),
  span(class = "child", id = "baby", "Ouinnnnn")
)

# access its name
myTag$name

# access its attributes (id and class)
myTag$attribs

# access children (returns a list of 2 elements)
myTag$children

```

How to modify the class of the second child?

```r
second_children <- myTag$children[[2]]
second_children$attribs$class <- "adult"
myTag

# Hummm, this is not working ...
```

The code above is wrong. Indeed, by assigning `myTag$children[[2]]` to second_children,
`second_children$attribs$class <- "adult"` modifies the class of the copy and not the
original object. Only one way:

```r
myTag$children[[2]]$attribs$class <- "adult"
myTag
```

For strongly nested tags, you will see that the following section contains amazing functions,
such as `tagAppenChild()`.


### Useful functions for Tags
htmltools and shiny have powerful functions to easily add attributes to tags, check for 
existing attributes, get attributes and add other tags to a list of tags.

- `tagAppendAttributes()`: this function allow you to add a new attribute to the current tag.
For instance, assuming you created a div for which you forgot to add and id attribute:

```r
mydiv <- div("Where is my brain")
mydiv <- tagAppendAttributes(mydiv, id = "here_it_is")
```

You can pass as many attributes as you want, including non standard attributes such as 
`data-toggle` (see Bootstrap 3 tabs for instance):

```r
mydiv <- tagAppendAttributes(mydiv, `data-toggle` = "tabs")
# even though you could proceed as follows
mydiv$attribs[["aria-controls"]] <- "home"
```

- `tagHasAttribute()`: to check if a tag has a specific attribute

```r
# I want to know if div has a class
mydiv <- div(class = "myclass")
has_class <- tagHasAttribute(mydiv, "class")
has_class

# if you are familiar with %>%
has_class <- mydiv %>% tagHasAttribute("class")
has_class
```
 
- `tagGetAttribute()`: to get the value of the targeted attributes, if it exists, otherwise NULL.

```r
mydiv <- div(class = "test")
# returns the class
tagGetAttribute(mydiv, "class")
# returns NULL
tagGetAttribute(mydiv, "id")
```

- `tagAppendChild()` and `tagAppendChildren()`: add other tags to an existing tag.
Whereas `tagAppendChild()` only takes on tag, you can pass a list of tags to `tagAppendChildren()`.

```r
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!")
otherTag <- span("I am your child")
mydiv <- tagAppendChild(mydiv, otherTag)
```

You might wonder why there is no `tagRemoveChild()` or `tagRemoveAttributes()`.

### Other interesting functions
The [brighter](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/brighter) package written by Colin Fay contains
very neat functions to edit your tags. Particularly, the `tagRemoveAttributes()`

```r
remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/brighter")
library(brighter)
```

```r
mydiv <- div(class = "test", id = "coucou", "Prout")
tagRemoveAttributes(mydiv, "class", "id")
```

Up to you to create new functions to add in this package and do a nice PR.

## Dependency utilities
When creating a new template, you sometimes need to import custom HTML dependencies
that do not come along with shiny. No problem, htmltools is here for you (shiny also 
contains these functions).

### The dirty approach
Let's consider the following example. I want to include a bootstrap 4 card in a shiny app.
This example is taken from an interesting question [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/create-a-div-using-htmltools-withtags/22439/2).
The naive approach would be to include the HTML code directly in the app code

```r
library(shiny)

# we create the card function before
my_card <- function(...) {
  htmltools::withTags(
    div(
      class = "card border-success mb-3",
      div(class = "card-header bg-transparent border-success"),
      div(
        class = "card-body text-success",
        h3(class = "card-title", "title"),
        p(class = "card-text", ...)
      ),
      div(class = "card-footer bg-transparent border-success", "footer")
    )
  )
}

# we build our app
shinyApp(
    ui = fluidPage(
      fluidRow(
       column(
        width = 6,
        align = "center",
        br(),
        my_card("blablabla. PouetPouet Pouet.")
       )
     )
    ),
    server = function(input, output) {}
)
```

and desesperately see that nothing is displayed. If you remember, this was expected since
shiny does not contain bootstrap 4 dependencies and this card is unfortunately a
bootstrap 4 object. Don't panic! We just need to tell shiny to load the css we need to display
this card (if required, we could include the javascript as well). We could use either
`includeCSS()`, `tags$head(tags$link(rel = "stylesheet", type = "text/css", href = "custom.css"))`. See
more [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html).

```r
shinyApp(
    ui = fluidPage(
      # load the css code
      includeCSS(path = "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"),
      fluidRow(
       column(
        width = 6,
        align = "center",
        br(),
        my_card("blablabla. PouetPouet Pouet.")
       )
     )
    ),
    server = function(input, output) {}
)
```

The card is ugly (which is another problem we will fix later) but at least displayed.

When I say this approach is dirty, it is because it will not be easily re-usable by others.
Instead, we prefer a packaging approach, like in the next section.

### The clean approach

We will use the `htmlDependency` and `attachDependencies` functions from htmltools.
The htmlDependency takes several arguments:

- the name of your dependency
- the version (useful to remember on which version it is built upon)
- a path to the dependency (can be a CDN or a local folder)
- script and stylesheet to respectively pass css and scripts

```r
# handle dependency
card_css <- "bootstrap.min.css"
bs4_card_dep <- function() {
  htmltools::htmlDependency(
    name = "bs4_card",
    version = "1.0",
    src = c(href = "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/"),
    stylesheet = card_css
  )
}
```

We create the card tag and give it the bootstrap 4 dependency through the `attachDependencies()`
function. 

```r
# create the card
my_card <- function(...) {
  cardTag <- htmltools::withTags(
    div(
      class = "card border-success mb-3",
      div(class = "card-header bg-transparent border-success"),
      div(
        class = "card-body text-success",
        h3(class = "card-title", "title"),
        p(class = "card-text", ...)
      ),
      div(class = "card-footer bg-transparent border-success", "footer")
    )
  )
  
  # attach dependencies
  htmltools::attachDependencies(cardTag, bs4_card_dep())
  
}

```

We finally run our app:

```r
# run shiny app 
ui <- fluidPage(
  title = "Hello Shiny!",
  fluidRow(
    column(
      width = 6,
      align = "center",
      br(),
      my_card("blablabla. PouetPouet Pouet.")
    )
  )
)

shinyApp(ui, server = function(input, output) { })
```

With this approach, you could develop a package of custom dependencies that people
could use when they need to add custom elements in shiny.
